## Readme

This is a silly game written in React and JSX by Jessica Rinks. It was written in an afternoon and shows basic React composition including the use of hooks, state, and JSX syntax. Its not pretty or perfect, but it was fun to make!

## To load the app:

1. Run the command `npm start`.
2. The app will start running in your browser at localhost:300.

## To play the game:

The object of the game is to water your plant so that it grows. But be careful. Watering your plan too quickly will produce a Too Much Water error and you'll have to start over. 

## TODOS:

-change the Try Again image to a dialog
-add Play Again dialog for when players get to the end of the game and want to start over
-add feature where each plant you succesfully grow will be added to a plants state and displayed below the game.
